This wheat blast disease risk assessment and early warning system (EWS) has been developed by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in partnership with EMBRAPA and the University of Passo Fundo in Brazil. This effort has been supported by  the USAID funded Climate Services for Resilient Development (CSRD) in South Asia project. In South Asia, CSRD focusses the development, supply and adaptation of agricultural climate services to reduce vulnerability by increasing resiliency in smallholder farming systems. CIMMYT and its partners work to mitigate wheat blast through projects supported by U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that supports CSRD, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR), CGIAR Research Program on WHEAT, and the CGIAR Platform on Big Data.
